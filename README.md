# Arithmetic Expression Parser

This is one of the small projects that I am
implementing to practice my parsing skills,
and eventually end up with a working compiler.

The program works as a repl that repeatedly take
input from stdin, and evaluate the arithmetic
expression and print it to stdout.

If the stdin contains invalid arithmetic expression,
the program will print out the error output to stderr.
